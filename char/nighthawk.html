					<p>
						Not exactly outgoing, Nighthawk is watchful and observant, and not particularly prone to idle chatter. She was known for having a bit of a temper when a warrior, almost certainly attributed to what she’s endured over the years. She’s started to mellow in her old age, and while no less vigilant, she’s less argumentative than she once was. She still enjoys telling younger cats (especially this new generation of unruly apprentices) what they need to hear, and is utterly disgusted that cats who haven’t seen their first winter yet think they know what is best for the clan. Nighthawk doesn’t really have a filter and can come off as acerbic, and delights in telling the younger generation what they probably don’t want to hear. She’s affectionate with only a small handful of cats, and almost never in public. She’s a very private individual and doesn’t enjoy her name in other’s mouths.

				<details><summary><h2>Backstory</h2></summary>
					<p>
						Nighthawk was born late-Crowstar-era (just before the start of Death from Beyond sitewide) as the only kit of Owlclaw and Stormstrike. She's apprenticed to an older warrior by the name of Stoneshard, and training was certainly eventful, with cats disappearing into the Mist, tribe cats slowly integrating into Skyclan life (and Skyclan adjusting to their presence) and later on, dogs. Things were often tense, and Nightpaw spent most of her days honing her battle skills and making sure the elders were cared for. She was more of the quiet type and wasn't one for idle conversation, but she was observant and always willing to help a fellow clanmate. She had friends among the other apprentices, of course, though Sprucesnow is perhaps the most notable of them (and one of the only ones still surviving from those days.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Nighthawk was made a warrior a few days before the start of Rippedstar's reign. Soon enough, Skyclan would have three successive leaders and several warriors die to dog attacks, including her own mentor. This and the eventful apprenticeship Nighthawk had just finished left the young warrior rather skittish, hyper-vigilant for danger and aware of her surroundings. She was rather aloof, even with her own clanmates aside from the few she could call friends. She fought against Lichenmask and the Regime/Exiles, feeling nothing but disgust for their group and the ones who would ever think of giving one cat such heinous abilities. In truth, she wasn't a fan of walking all over the code and acting like there wouldn't be consequences for wrong actions, but the idea of what Lichenmask wanted to do was sickening and she could not abide by such violence.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the Newleaf Tears sitewide, Nighthawk was part of the Skyclan group that wound up at Highstones with Tinystar, which... definitely didn't help her fear of dogs that stemmed from her days as an apprentice. Most of the scars that part her thick fur come from this fight, and it's usually the one most featured in her nightmares.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually, Skyclan was able to reunite and the dogs and sharptooth that prevented them from going back home was defeated. It was then that Nighthawk realized how being separated from her friends had affected her. She and Sprucesnow, the pair having been friendly with each other since their days as apprentices, admitted their feelings for each other and became mates. Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t long before a litter of kits was on the way, and the pair became parents.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nighthawk retired uneventfully just before Spottedstar became leader. She fled the forest with the rest of the clan after the fire in greenleaf, staying in first twolegplace, then Riverclan's camp. Upon returning to Skyclan's territory, she was blessed with grandkits around the time the Asylum took over the territory. Alongside Sprucesnow, Nighthawk was extremely stressed during Asylum's occupation, and did not live to see the clans freed. She was quite ill, and died in her sleep.
